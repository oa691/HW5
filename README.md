# HW5 Assignment_1
In this assignment I performed KS AD tests to citybike data for men and women age groups to confirm whether the data are normally distributed or not for normal and poisson distribution functions. Statistical interpretations are provided in the document.
I followed examples shown on https://github.com/fedhere/UInotebooks/blob/master/oh_my_goodness_of_fit.ipynb

# HW5 Assignment_3

Formulate the Null hypothesis in words and in formulae for the 4 experiments below:

Idea: Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?
Null Hypothesis: Amount fat lose for average over-weight among mid-age indivuals is same or less than the control group with daily execise.
Alternative Hypothesis: Amount of fat lose through a diet is more effective than the fat lose through physical exercise
H0: P1 - P2 => 0
Ha: P1 - P2 < 0

Do American trust the president?
Idea: Through all the observation about Bill Clinton does he now have the honesty and integrity for a president?
Null Hypothesis: Bill Clinton's integrity and honesty same or less now for a president than it is before May 1994.
Alternative Hypothesis: Bill Clinton's integrity and honesty is higher for a president then before May 1994.
H0: P1 - P2 => 0
Ha: P1 - P2 < 0


idea: Effectiveness of nicotine patches to quit smoking.
Null Hypothesis: Cessation rates among smokers who use nicotine patches are same or lower than the rates among control group with placebo patches.
Alternative Hypothesis: Cessation rates are higher with nicotine patches.
H0: P1 - P2 => 0
Ha: P1 - P2 < 0

Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women.
Smoking during pregnancy result in lower IQ among children.

Null Hypothesis: The IQ tests scores among children 1 through 4 year old whose mothers have smoked during pregnancy is same or higher than childeren of the same age group whose mothers have not smoked during pregancy.

Alternative Hypothesis: Children 1 through 4 years old whose mothers have smoked tobbaco during 9 month pregnancy score less on IQ tests than those children ages 1 through 4 whose mothers have not smoked during pregnancy

H0: P1 = P2 
Ha: P1 â‰  P2
